# it is ok and normal for developers to run into errors.  You have to train yourself to not panic or have anxiety anytime one is encountered

# example 1 - NameError

# first_name = "Jason"
# # 50 lines down
# print(firstname) 

# example 2 - TypeError

# print("5" + 3) 
# print(3 + "5")

# line 11 Python thinks you're trying to concatenate
# line 8 Python thinks you're trying to add

# both with produce a TypeError but they are different types of TypeErrors

# example 3 - ValueError

# int("xyz") here the strings value is incorrect, should be a string number for it to type conversion to occur correctly

# example 4 - SyntaxError

# print("hello) is missing the end quotes and produces a syntax error
